# Google Images Downloader App
This project is a web application hosted on Streamlit that allows users to search and download images from Google in bulk, based on a Query/Keyword they enter. It utilizes the **google_images_search** API to fetch and download images directly from Google.

**Key Features:**
-Image Search: Users can input a keyword to search for specific images.

-Custom Download: Users can specify the number of images they want to download (up to 100).

-Download as Zip: After the images are fetched, they are compressed into a zip file, which can be easily downloaded.

-Email Functionality: Users can also provide an email address, and the web app will send the zip file containing the images directly to their inbox.
